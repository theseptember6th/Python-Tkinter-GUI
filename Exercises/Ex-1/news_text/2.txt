Kylian Mbappé joins Real Madrid from Paris Saint-Germain

Real Madrid announced the signing of French superstar Kylian Mbappé on a five-year deal on Monday, ending one of the longest-running transfer sagas in soccer.

Mbappé’s move from Paris Saint-Germain comes two days after Real won a record-extending 15th European Cup with victory over Borussia Dortmund, adding further star quality to the team’s attack.

The 25-year-old, who became PSG’s record scorer during the seven years he spent at the French club, will link up with the likes of Vinícius Jr. and Jude Bellingham – two of the world’s best players – in the Spanish capital to form a potential soccer dynasty.
