Cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane will join Nepal’s T20 World Cup squad in the West Indies.
The 23-year-old leg spinner has already reached the West Indies. He will play Nepal’s last two group matches against South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17 in Kingstown, St Vincent.
He will be joined by the rest of the squad who will travel to the Caribbean following their second group match against Sri Lanka which is scheduled to take place in Lauderhill, the United States on Wednesday.
Nepal lost their opening match of the Group D against the Netherlands by six wickets in Dallas last Tuesday.
Lamichhane, who last month was acquitted of rape on appeal, was unable to travel to the United States for the World Cup after the US Embassy in Kathmandu denied him visa twice despite initiatives from the government, Cricket Association of Nepal and other stakeholders.
“Hello from the West Indies! I would like to thank the Government of Nepal, Foreign Ministry, Sports Ministry, National Sports Council, and Cricket Association of Nepal for their support to help me get the US visa…but unfortunately, it did not work out this time,” Lamichhane wrote on his Facebook post after landing in the West Indies on Monday.
“But now through all of that aside, I am now joining the national team for the last two matches in the West Indies,” he further wrote.
Earlier on Monday, Nepal’s cricket governing body CAN had issued a press release informing about Lamichhane’s travel to the West Indies.
